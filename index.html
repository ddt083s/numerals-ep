    <!-- Start -->
    <section class="track">
      <h2>Start</h2>
      <p><strong>Description:</strong> An urgent rallying cry that opens the EP with a commanding mic-check vibe. The narrator safeguards listeners with the refrain “Never worry,” assuring them that “the unjust are put to rest” and “truth prevails.” Spanning globally from “England to New York” and “Scotland to your porch,” the song invokes the “torch of liberty” to scorch societal prejudices. It directly condemns racism as a “pandemic,” dissects xenophobic taunts, and ends with a commitment to “start” the fight for justice, urging listeners to seek truth and help those oppressed.</p>

    <!-- Zero -->
    <section class="track">
      <h2>Zero</h2>
      <p><strong>Description:</strong> A dark, nihilistic odyssey into emptiness and rage. The opening bars depict surreal nightmares and fantastical beasts, symbolizing a fractured psyche. References to growing “white hairs from nightmares” and “meatriding nosediving while black Friday sent me sideways” convey disorientation. The chorus proclaims total autonomy—zero hits, zero recognition, zero grace—defiantly embracing obscurity. Verse two descends into addiction imagery, contrasting methadone rehabilitation with fentanyl’s lure, while graphically depicting violence as an outlet. The final verse lashes out at the music industry, positioning the narrator as a “king of this cathedral” unbound by convention. Vivid metaphors—chainsaws, Cain’s betrayal, hacky sack distractions—underscore a relentless quest for self-assertion. The repeated vow “I do it my way” affirms unyielding individuality amid chaos.</p>

    <!-- Numerals -->
    <section class="track">
      <h2>Numerals</h2>
      <p><strong>Description:</strong> The conceptual centerpiece, “Numerals” delves into obsession, self-destruction, and the weight of time. The first verse portrays an insatiable “appetite” for unnamable forces, as escalating angst drives the narrator to “flip over tables” and tally “killers’ coldest kills.” Verse two conveys mounting frustration—a race against time amid anguish—while the sky remains a limit with “no pressure” despite internal chaos. The final verse reflects on achievements and creative burnout: rhyming schemes unravel, the craving for lyrical excellence endures, and “crunching numbers” becomes an allegory for relentless ambition. The outro directly cites Robert Frost’s “Nothing gold can stay,” underscoring impermanence and the ephemeral nature of success. This track bridges “Zero”’s void with “Finite”’s exploration of limits, anchoring the EP’s numerological theme.</p>

    <!-- Finite -->
    <section class="track">
      <h2>Finite</h2>
      <p><strong>Description:</strong> A rapid-fire manifesto on ambition and mortality. The narrator ignites with “spark a fire” fervor, battling opponents and pushing “limits” in a bid to be a top-five writer. Cosmic metaphors—“set the sky aflame with lighters” and “intergalactical” potency—contrast with gritty imagery, such as lyrics “stronger than the flu” and vengeance reminiscent of the Kool-Aid Man. Pop culture nods to Doechii and Kendrick spotlight industry benchmarks, while sports and comic references (Sue Storm, Tyson, Jordan) illustrate the drive to dominate. Verse three exposes self-doubt and the monstrous will to “wear the rings,” yet pivots to a desire to uplift the “hurt and the shamed.” The chorus warns that “dreams and earth will collide” and that time is finite—urging immediacy. An outro evoking “’95, ’96 and on and on” symbolizes an ongoing quest beyond generational bounds.</p>

    <!-- Infinity -->
    <section class="track">
      <h2>Infinity</h2>
      <p><strong>Description:</strong> An anthem of defiance against nepotism and an ode to self-made perseverance. Verse one depicts street survival (“about to get shot”) juxtaposed with aspiration to “level of Nas or Pac” and gratitude for the year’s highs. The hook—“Never did a nepo baby ever make it first”—lambasts unearned privilege, while verses two and three wrestle with trauma, self-hate, and lyrical purpose. Metaphors of riddles, flames, and “fables like beauty and honour” underscore a mission to enlighten the marginalized. The bridge reasserts the “nepo baby” hook, and the final chorus celebrates underdog triumph. The outro’s call to “grab on to infinity” extends the EP’s thematic arc from “Finite” to limitless possibility.</p>

    <!-- Finite (Infinite Remix) -->
    <section class="track">
      <h2>Finite (Infinite Remix)</h2>
      <p><strong>Description:</strong> Melding Eminem’s “Infinite” instrumental with “Finite”’s lyrics, this remix pays homage while intensifying the track’s existential urgency. It recontextualizes finite struggles over a beat that originally celebrated Eminem’s early ambitions, symbolizing the bridging of two eras and the relentless push against limitations.</p>
